# Final Fantasy Character Data

## Purpose

The purpose of this website is to use the fan-made Final Fantasy XIV API to communicate with the server to search character specific data separated by the server the character is located on.

>> Example: 'Mellow Mushroom' on server 'Zalera'

This will return character data for the character with the name Mellow Mushroom located on the Zalera server on the Crystal data center.

Once the character's stats have been pulled, a secondary API will be pinged that provides us with the character's favorite joke to tell in their local tavern.
