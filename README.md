# Final Fantasy Character Data

## Purpose

The purpose of this website is to use the fan-made Final Fantasy XIV API to communicate with the server to search character specific data separated by the server the character is located on.

>> Example: 'Mellow Mushroom' on server 'Zalera'

This will return character data for the character with the name Mellow Mushroom located on the Zalera server on the Crystal data center.
